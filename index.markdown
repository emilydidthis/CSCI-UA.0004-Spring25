## Class Format
The class will meet twice a week for one hour and fifteen minutes. Typically, each week will include a blend of lecture material, asynchronous video lessons, interactive class discussions, and a project-based assignment. To support your learning and progress on assignments, dedicated workshop time will be provided during class. These workshops offer an opportunity to work collaboratively with your peers and receive direct support from me, the professor.

## Attendance + Participation
Due to the sequential nature of this course, consistent and punctual in-person attendance is essential and will be factored into your grade. If you plan on missing a class due to religious observance, military commitment or an NYU athletic commitment, please fill out the [short term absence form]({{site.absence-form}}), as these are considered excused absences as per NYU attendance policy. Filling out the form must be done prior to the absence and cannot be filled out retroactively. If you are feeling ill, please notify me the day of via Ed by posting a private thread under the Admin category.

Participation is also a significant part of your grade. The best way to participate, aside from attending class, is to be active on our [Ed Discussion]({{ site.ed }}) board. This can be through asking questions, answering questions from your peers, or responding to the discussion questions I post. 


<!-- ## i6 Account
In addition to your NYU Home Account, we will be using a web hosting account on a Unix server which will be assigned to you automatically based on your enrollment. This is called an [“i6” account](https://cims.nyu.edu/webapps/content/systems/resources/i6) and we will use it to host our websites. Common questions about i6 accounts are answered on this [FAQ page](https://cims.nyu.edu/webapps/content/systems/resources/i6/faq). If you forget your i6 password and would like to reset it, go to [this page](https://cims.nyu.edu/webapps/content/systems/resources/i6/resetpassword) for instructions on how to do so.

## Computers and File Backup
As class time will include live coding and individual exercises, you are encouraged to bring a laptop computer. There are also multiple [student technology centers](https://www.nyu.edu/life/information-technology/teaching-and-learning-services/studios-and-computing-labs/student-technology-centers-computer-labs.html) on campus. Make sure to save copies of your projects and back them up to other media, such as an external drive or use a version control system like [GitHub](https://github.com/).
